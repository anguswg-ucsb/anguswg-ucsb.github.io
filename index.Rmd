## Hello, my name is Angus

I am 23 years old and was born and raised in Santa Barbara, California.I am in my final year at UCSB. My interests include running, biking, making art, computer science, and GIS. I am looking forward to learning as much as I can from 176A and the rest of the remote sensing courses.
