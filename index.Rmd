# ANGUS WATTERS

***

### **Welcome to my website!**
My name is Angus Watters. I am a senior at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am majoring in Geography with an emphasis on GIS and I expect to graduate in the Spring of 2021. I am able to code in both Python and R. Within R I am proficient in cleaning, organizing, and analyzing spatial and non-spatial data. I am currently most interested in working in the field of water resources and environmental conservation, but I keep an open mind with the primary goal to continue growing.

 As I near graduation, I am searching for opportunities where I can both apply and improve my skills in cleaning, organizing, and analyzing spatial and non-spatial data. I hope to find a position which matches my interest in environmental conservation, resource management, and data curation.

In my free time I enjoy spending time running, biking, drawing, gardening, and cooking.
