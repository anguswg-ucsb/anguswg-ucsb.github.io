This is my projects section for Geography 176A. This is my first attempt at building a website using RStudio and GitHub.


##### Lab 1 learning points:

  - create a new repository on GitHub
  - using a yml file to give R directions on how to assemble a website
  - using R Markdown to add information 
  - knitting it to a webpage


[Lab 2: Data Wrangling](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-02.html)

##### Learning points:

  - reading in data using readr
  - Dplyer verbs(select, filter, mutate, group_by, summarize, arrange)
  - join functions to combine data sets 
  - knitr::kable and pull()
  - calculate number of New cases using lag()
  - ggplot (add data, layers, labels, themes, facets)
  - testing 'message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE in R Markdown

[Lab 3: Projections, Distances, and Mapping](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-03.html)

##### Learning points:

  - using Sf package:
    - st_as_sf to create a special feature object from a data fram
    - st_transform to change CRS from angular measurements to meters
    - st_distance to calculate the distance from points to Multilinestrings
  - using units package:
    - set units() from meters to km
    - drop_units()
  - assigning labels to specified points on plot
  
[Lab 4: Tesselations, Spatial Joins, and Point-in-Polygon](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-04.html)

##### Learning points:

  - generated centroids as anchor points for tessellations
    - st_as_sf to create a special feature object from a data fram
    - st_transform to change CRS from angular measurements to meters
    - st_distance to calculate the distance from points to Multilinestrings
  - Tessellations:
    - Voroni, triangulation, square grid, and hexagonal grid
    - understanding the pros and cons of using different tesselations based on desired analysis
  - using st_intersection to crop our tessellation to only the desired geometry 
  - Simplified borders to decrease the number of calculation
    - Decreased time to run and demand on hardware and software
    - rmapshaper::ms_simplify 
    - mapview:npts
  - function building
  - Point-in-polygon analysis


[Lab 05: Rasters analysis and Remote Sensing](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-05.html)

##### Learning points:

  - create rasters
    - raster stacks and raster bricks
    - bounty boxes
    - extent, resolution, dimensions of a raster
  - LSAT imagery and rasters
    - RGB colors to empasize certain image traits
  - Applying thresholds to raster images
  - kmeans analysis

[Lab 6: Terrain Analysis](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-06.html)

##### Learning points:

  - Open Street Map
    - Performed Overpass queries on key, tag combinations
    - Extracted polygon and lines features from OSM database
  - Whitebox tools
    - Slope, aspect, contour, and HAND rasters
  - Terrain analysis
  - Flood Impact assessment 
    - Impacted buildings
