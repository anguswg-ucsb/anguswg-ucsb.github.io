This is my projects section for Geography 176A. This is my first attempt at building a website using RStudio and GitHub.


# Lab 1 learning points:

  - create a new repository on GitHub
  - using a yml file to give R directions on how to assemble a website
  - using R Markdown to add information 
  - knitting it to a webpage


[Lab 2](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-02.html)
# Lab 2 learning points:

  - reading in data using readr
  - Dplyer verbs(select, filter, mutate, group_by, summarize, arrange)
  - join functions to combine data sets 
  - knitr::kable and pull()
  - calculate number of New cases using lag()
  - ggplot (add data, layers, labels, themes, facets)
  - testing 'message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE in R Markdown

[Lab 3](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-03.html)
# Lab 3 learning points:

  - using Sf package:
    - st_as_sf to create a special feature object from a data fram
    - st_transform to change CRS from angular measurements to meters
    - st_distance to calculate the distance from points to Multilinestrings
  - using units package:
    - set units() from meters to km
    - drop_units()
  - assigning labels to specified points on plot
  
[Lab 4](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-04.html)
# Lab 4 learning points:

  - generated centroids as anchor points for tessellations
    - st_as_sf to create a special feature object from a data fram
    - st_transform to change CRS from angular measurements to meters
    - st_distance to calculate the distance from points to Multilinestrings
  - Tessellations:
    - Voroni, triangulation, square grid, and hexagonal grid
    - understanding the pros and cons of using different tesselations based on desired analysis
  - using st_intersection to crop our tessellation to only the desired geometry 
  - Simplified borders to decrease the number of calculation
    - Decreased time to run and demand on hardware and software
    - rmapshaper::ms_simplify 
    - mapview:npts
  - function building
  - Point-in-polygon analysis
