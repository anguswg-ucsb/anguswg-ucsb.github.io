This is my projects section for Geography 176A. This is my first attempt at building a website using RStudio and GitHub.


# A few things I've learned from Lab 1:

  - create a new repository on GitHub
  - using a yml file to give R directions on how to assemble a website
  - using Rmarkdown to add information, and Knitting it to a webpage
